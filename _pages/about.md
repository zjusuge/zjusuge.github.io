# **👋 About Me**

I am a PhD student at Zhejiang University (ZJU), currently participating in a joint training program at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). My research is situated at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Disaster Prevention and Mitigation**.

Specifically, I focus on leveraging machine learning and deep learning frameworks to enhance the **early warning, spatiotemporal prediction, and intelligent mitigation** of geological hazards, such as debris flows and landslides.

You can find my research profile and real-time citation count on <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JNiHto0AAAAJ'>Google Scholar <img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.
