# **👋 About Me**

I am a PhD student at Zhejiang University (ZJU), currently in a joint training program at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). My research interests lie at the intersection of **Disaster Prevention and Mitigation** and **Artificial Intelligence**. 

Specifically, I focus on leveraging machine learning and deep learning to enhance the prediction, monitoring, and mitigation of geological hazards, particularly landslides and debris flows. 

You can find my research profile and real-time citation count on <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JNiHto0AAAAJ'>Google Scholar <img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.
